# Lawnicons

A Lawnicons repo forked from the [official Lawnicons reop](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons) for my personal use

## Disclaimer
This repo was about to be forked from the main branch of official Lanwicons repo at release tag 2.0.0, but due to [renewal of Github policy](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-you-can-now-fork-a-repo-and-copy-only-the-default-branch/), the main branch as a non-default branch cannot be forked meanwhile the default branch would cause some dependencies issue on my local WSL2 setup. At the end I have to clone the specific branch and push it to my own repo with my personal commits added to that branch.

## Download
